#Array properties in JavaScript

Arrays in javascript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. The various key properties of arrays in JavaScript:

1. length: The length property of an array returns the number of elements in the array.

2. toString(): The toString() method of an array returns a string that represents the contents of the array.

3. join(): The join() method returns a string that represents the contents of the array, with elements separated by a specified separator.

4. pop(): The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

5. push(): The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

6. shift(): The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that element.

7. unshift(): The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

8. slice(): The slice() method returns a new array containing a portion of the original array.

9. splice(): The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
