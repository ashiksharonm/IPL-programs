OBJECTIVES:

1. To be familiar with Web page design using HTML/XML and style sheets
2. To be exposed to creation of user interfaces using Java frames and applets.
3. To learn to create dynamic web pages using server side scripting.
4. To learn to write Client Server applications.
5. To be familiar with the PHP programming.
6. To be exposed to creating applications with AJAX


LIST OF EXPERIMENTS

* Create a web page with the following using HTML a. To embed a map in a web page b. To fix the hot spots in that map c. Show all the related information when the hot spots are clicked.
* Create a web page with the following. a. Cascading style sheets. b. Embedded style sheets. c. Inline style sheets.
* Validate the Registration, user login, user profile and payment by credit card pages using JavaScript.
* Write programs in Java using Servlets: i. To invoke servlets from HTML forms ii. Session tracking using hidden form fields and Session tracking for a hit count
* Write programs in Java to create three-tier applications using servlets for conducting on-line examination for displaying student mark list. Assume that student information is available in a database which has been stored in a database server.
* Install TOMCAT web server. Convert the static web pages of programs into dynamic web pages using servlets (or JSP) and cookies. Hint: Users information (user id, password, credit card number) would be stored in web.xml. Each user should have a separate Shopping Cart.
* Redo the previous task using JSP by converting the static web pages into dynamic web pages. Create a database with user information and books information. The books catalogue should be dynamically loaded from the database.
* Create and save an XML document at the server, which contains 10 users Information. Write a Program, which takes user Id as an input and returns the User details by taking the user information from the XML document
    i. Validate the form using PHP regular expression. ii. PHP stores a form data into database.
* Write a web service for finding what people think by asking 500 peopleâ€˜s opinion for any consumer product.
                                                                                                 

OUTCOMES:

Upon Completion of the course, the students will be able to:

* Construct Web pages using HTML/XML and style sheets.
* Build dynamic web pages with validation using Java Script objects and by applying different event handling mechanisms.
* Develop dynamic web pages using server side scripting.
* Use PHP programming to develop web applications.
* Construct web applications using AJAX and web services
